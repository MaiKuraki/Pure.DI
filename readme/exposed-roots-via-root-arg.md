#### Exposed roots via root arg

Composition roots from other assemblies or projects can be used as a source of bindings passed through root arguments. When you add a binding to a composition from another assembly or project, the roots of the composition with the `RootKind.Exposed` type will be used in the bindings automatically. For example, in some assembly a composition is defined as:
```c#
public partial class CompositionInOtherProject
{
    private static void Setup() =>
        DI.Setup()
            .Bind().As(Lifetime.Singleton).To<MyDependency>()
            .Bind().To<MyService>()
            .Root<IMyService>("MyService", kind: RootKinds.Exposed);
}
```


```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using OtherAssembly;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // Binds to exposed composition roots from other project
    .RootArg<CompositionInOtherProject>("baseComposition")
    .Root<Program>("GetProgram");

var baseComposition = new CompositionInOtherProject();
var composition = new Composition();
var program = composition.GetProgram(baseComposition);
program.DoSomething();

partial class Program(IMyService myService)
{
    public void DoSomething() => myService.DoSomething();
}
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>At this point, a composition from another assembly or another project can be used for this purpose. Compositions from the current project cannot be used in this way due to limitations of the source code generators.

The following partial class will be generated:

```c#
partial class Composition
{
#if NET9_0_OR_GREATER
  private readonly Lock _lock = new Lock();
#else
  private readonly Object _lock = new Object();
#endif

  [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
  public Program GetProgram(OtherAssembly.CompositionInOtherProject baseComposition)
  {
    if (baseComposition is null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(baseComposition));
    OtherAssembly.IMyService transientIMyService50;
    OtherAssembly.CompositionInOtherProject localInstance_1182D1274 = baseComposition;
    transientIMyService50 = localInstance_1182D1274.MyService;
    return new Program(transientIMyService50);
  }
}
```
