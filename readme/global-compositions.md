#### Global compositions

When the `Setup(name, kind)` method is called, the second optional parameter specifies the composition kind. If you set it as `CompositionKind.Global`, no composition class will be created, but this setup will be the base setup for all others in the current project, and `DependsOn(...)` is not required. The setups will be applied in the sort order of their names.
When this occurs: you need this feature while building the composition and calling roots.
What it solves: provides a clear setup pattern and expected behavior without extra boilerplate or manual wiring.
How it is solved in the example: shows the minimal DI configuration and how the result is used in code.


```c#
using Pure.DI;
using static Pure.DI.CompositionKind;

return;

class MyGlobalComposition
{
    static void Setup() =>
        DI.Setup(kind: Global)
            .Hint(Hint.ToString, "Off")
            .Hint(Hint.FormatCode, "On");
}

class MyGlobalComposition2
{
    static void Setup() =>
        DI.Setup("Some name", kind: Global)
            .Hint(Hint.ToString, "On");
}
```
