$h=Interception is the ability to intercept calls between objects in order to enrich or change their behavior, but without having to change their code. A prerequisite for interception is weak binding. That is, if programming is abstraction-based, the underlying implementation can be transformed or improved by "packaging" it into other implementations of the same abstraction. At its core, intercept is an application of the Decorator design pattern. This pattern provides a flexible alternative to inheritance by dynamically "attaching" additional responsibility to an object. Decorator "packs" one implementation of an abstraction into another implementation of the same abstraction like a "matryoshka doll".
$h=_Decorator_ is a well-known and useful design pattern. It is convenient to use tagged dependencies to build a chain of nested decorators, as in the example below:
$h=When this occurs: you need this feature while building the composition and calling roots.
$h=What it solves: provides a clear setup pattern and expected behavior without extra boilerplate or manual wiring.
$h=How it is solved in the example: shows the minimal DI configuration and how the result is used in code.
$f=
$f=Here an instance of the _TextWidget_ type, labeled _"base"_, is injected in the decorator _BoxWidget_. You can use any tag that semantically reflects the feature of the abstraction being embedded. The tag can be a constant, a type, or a value of an enumerated type.
$f=What it shows:
$f=- Demonstrates the scenario setup and resulting object graph in Pure.DI.
$f=
$f=Important points:
$f=- Highlights the key configuration choices and their effect on resolution.
$f=
$f=Useful when:
$f=- You want a concrete template for applying this feature in a composition.
