## Errors

### DIE000
- Description: Unable to resolve a dependency in the object graph.
- Problem: The generator cannot find a binding or auto-binding that satisfies a required injection.
- Fix: Add a binding for the missing abstraction or enable/allow auto-binding for the concrete type.
- See: [injections-of-abstractions](readme/injections-of-abstractions.md).
- Examples: A root depends on a service that has no binding.

### DIE001
- Description: Binding cannot be built due to missing binding metadata.

- See: [simplified-binding](readme/simplified-binding.md).
- Examples: Binding is incomplete or the setup call is malformed.

### DIE002
- Description: Binding is invalid because the compiler reported errors.

- Problem: `Resolve` cannot supply generic type arguments.
- Fix: Use explicit roots or avoid Resolve for generic roots.
- See: [resolve-methods](readme/resolve-methods.md).
- Examples: Generic roots with `Resolve` methods.

### DIW007
- Description: DependsOn uses an instance member.
- Problem: A binding in a dependent setup references an instance member that will not exist in the dependent composition.
